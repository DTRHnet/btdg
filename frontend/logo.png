# Logo Placeholder

This file should be replaced with an actual PNG logo image (200x200 pixels recommended).

For development purposes, you can:
1. Download a logo from the original BTDigg site
2. Create your own logo
3. Use a placeholder image service

The logo should be named "logo.png" and placed in the frontend/ directory.
